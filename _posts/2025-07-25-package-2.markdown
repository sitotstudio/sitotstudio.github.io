description: Multiple portraits made for a same person. This package is for people looking to capture changes, growth, or multiple versions of themselves or a person of their choice. We will work with you to time the snapshots accordingly, so please let us know if there are specific arrangements that need to be made. Some scenarios that are a perfect fit for this package include (1) capturing a child's growth every set number of months or years. (2) A before and after snapshot capture when there is a known upcoming transformative experience. (3) Neurodiverse snapshots for DID systems, flareups, BPD or various state of minds.
