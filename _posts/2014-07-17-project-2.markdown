description: Limited seats are available every month. The mini portrait series is like an amuse-bouche of our very best; a select list of our most impactful visual descriptors, a shorter curated questionnaire, and a smaller canvas for a concentrated straight-forward personality capture. For those who want the fastest turn-around, a truly unique gift that doubles as a special experience, or a great way to have a taste of personality portraits before committing to a full piece. No matter your reasons, you deserve, quite literally, to be seen!
