description: A software model built for you, with mapping logic and output visual descriptors that match your tastes. Are you an artist looking to make personality art pieces of your own, in the artform of your choice? Whether your domain is abstract sculptures, stained glass, woodwork, guo hua, or even unique painting style inclinations, this is a commission for our engineering team to create a new snapshot model with custom visual descriptors that are intentionally paired with your medium and art style. The mapping weights will also be calibrated to your specific artistic sensibilities/tastes and a full training session will be provided so you feel comfortable knowing the ins and outs of your own snapshot software! Note that our studio is open for artist collabs using our existing classic snapshot model as well, please contact us if that interests you!
