Just like how your physical appearance is expected to change, who you are inside changes and grows with time and experiences. Our snapshot session captures your personality at that point in time like a photograph, accurately reflecting who you are in that moment, and mapping all your facets to visual characteristics we call your visual descriptor profile.</p>

Your physical appearance plays no role in the design, instead we measure which visuals capture your vibes best. From colours, composition, textures, to painting techniques, over 40 descriptors inform the final look and feel of your art piece. We start by talking through your snapshot results with you, as we share our initial thoughts on colour palette and general design. Once the general direction is greenlit, we let our artists do what they do best. We do not take the trust given to us lightly, and thus it is our priority to combine accuracy with aesthetics in each design.</p>

Each art piece comes with your visual descriptor profile (the results of the snapshot session), an artist's statement that highlights key design decisions made based on your results, and a certificate of authenticity. Due to the quality and bespoke nature of our art, each art piece will require at least a month to complete once the design is greenlit.</p>
