                        With a lifetime of finding themselves at intersections, Ké created Sitôt as a space to explore the questions that also find themselves in these junctions.<br>
                        Ké's particular area of interest lies in art as a way to communicate, to learn about the self, what it reveals about social/individual perception, and how software can genuinely aid creative expression instead of bypassing it.<br>
                        How much do we know about ourselves? What are our limitations in how we can convey who we are? In what ways do we form our understanding of ourselves based on others' perceptions? How does our language and its categorization of personality "traits" affect our view of others and ourselves? What are ways we can share defining parts of ourselves that go unspoken?<br>
                        If these lines of thought are interesting to you, consider joining the studio, or stopping by for a chat!
                        <br><br>
                        Ké is a software engineer turned full-time artist, with a tech background in machine learning, graphics, and computer vision that they have built a career with at companies like Autodesk and Microsoft. 
                        On the arts side, Ké is a classical pianist under 15 years of tutelage from Moscow Tchaikovsky Conservatory alum E. Dyachkov, as well as a published researcher as part of the Distributed Digital Music Archives and Libraries' effort to digitalize a collection of medieval square-notation sheet music through machine-led optical music recognition. 
                        However, Ké's heart has always been with visual arts, from ink on paper to paint on canvas, Ké intends on staying on the studio's artist roster even when the business paperwork starts piling up!
