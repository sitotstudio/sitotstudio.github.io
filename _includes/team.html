                        Sit√¥t is a bit of a full circle moment.<br>
                        In a whirlwind of a life journey, our founder went from being a classical music teacher, visual artist, and palm-reader, to seeing the limitations of corporate frameworks of conflict resolution and personality-type-based team building as an HR director, to being a software engineer, publishing machine learning papers, and running global engineering teams at Microsoft just to realize... This ain't it.<br>
                        Indeed, our studio is born of our founder's collision of artistry, traditional chinese family lore, academia, and a corporate tech career that lead to not only a particularly interdisciplinary skillset, but also, a particularly empowering disillusionment. 
                        This has given us a unique perspective in how we approach software, and how we think about its applications. On the other hand, our deep understanding of tech, AI, and its biases has given us confidence in proposing our own ways of using software in the realm of fine arts that centers respect towards the craft and the joy of creating.<br>
                        The result is something we believe is special, and gives everyone involved in the process of creating our personality portraits a reason to care about the final art piece on a personal level, from the subject of our art (you!), to the many fields of expertise required along the way to make the portraits come to life.
