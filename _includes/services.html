                    <p class="service-description text-muted">Since we aim to create art about you, our artists are faced with the challenge of combining representational accuracy (respecting the constraints of your visual profile) with each their seasoned craft, skill, and artistic tastes to bring your art piece to life. How do we combine characteristics that are, like many human beings, contradictory? How do we capture a "vibe" through conceptual constraints (given by your personality), while also balancing aesthetics? <br>By keeping our art 100% human, each art piece inherently would not exist without you or our artists, creating results that are truly bespoke, unique, and irreplaceable.</p>

                    <p class="service-description text-muted">Intuitively, an organized person feels more "geometric" and "linear". What if this same person also thrives in a chaotic and messy environment, how would that translate to visuals? How do existing limitations in personality tests inform and affect the way questionnaires are made? How do we represent a human being without categorizing them? These ideas are at the basis of the theories we explore and expand on to capture all facets of a complex and evolving human being through visual metaphors. <br>Our work is rooted in academia, but fundamentally challenges the over-representation of colonial understanding of human behaviour, affecting how we approach understanding personalities, and which commonly coined personality "traits" have been made to oppose another. Our approach to personality mapping is fun, scientifically rigorous, cross-cultural, iterative, and you may find that it captures sides of you that no other test has ever captured.</p>

                    <p class="service-description text-muted">Our team of software engineers are first and foremost academics and creatives. We believe that software of scale does not find its best application in the realm of art. Our software is crafted in a way that is intertwined with the human touch, and extensive domain knowledge (in our case, the worlds of personality testing, visual metaphor theory, and cross-modal perception). How do we ensure accuracy and consistency when evaluating vastly different or eerily similar people? How do your interactions with the user interface affect the accuracy of your answers? How do we bring our academic research into practice, and bridge the intimate knowledge you have of yourself with an artist who intends to represent you without having met you? These are some of the many questions that inform our software design.</p>
