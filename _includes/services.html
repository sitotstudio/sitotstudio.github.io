                        The artworks produced at Sitôt are all individually hand-painted using professional gallery-grade archival acrylics, on 100% cotton canvases, hand-stretched over frames made of locally-sourced wood from the pacific northwest. <br><br>
                        Based on centuries of psychological evidence, Sitôt's processes make use of the concept that constraints enhance creativity by providing human artists with text-based design constraints (the results of the snapshot questionnaire). This is a key driving force behind how each art piece is not only truly bespoke and unique, but also an immense joy for artists to create, with evidence of pushing creativity to new heights.<br><br>

                        Sitôt's snapshot questionnaire captures who you are at a moment in time, since, like our physical body, our thoughts are also expected to change and grow with time.<br><br>
                        The snapshot questionnaire consists of 60 questions that build an understanding of you; how you perceive yourself, how you portray yourself to others, how others perceive you, how you want to be perceived, how much your environment influences you, and additional questions derived from CPAI traits. Each question impacts, at varying degrees, the list of 40 visual descriptors that form your visual descriptor profile. The weight of the impact of each question on each descriptor is determined by cross-modal perception theories validated through willing participants on several fronts: impressions of the selected descriptors, blind identification tests of finished canvases, and experiences of learning -- of others and the self -- through visual profiles and final art pieces.<br><br>
                        This is an area of research that is very old, with significant cross-cultural/global interest throughout history, and yet very young in terms of consensus due to the complex nature of the human psyche. Know that with each portrait, you not only contribute to the arts, but also to the science of human understanding.<br><br>

                    <p class="service-description text-muted">
                        To leverage quantum properties like superposition and entanglement, which perhaps not so coincidentally are properties of human thought and behaviour, the results of the snapshot questionnaire are calculated through a combination of classical computing and a layer of quandtum circuits. This means the code used to create your visual profile can legitimately be run on a real quantum computer!<br><br>
                        Through domain knowledge the variance your answers create for each visual descriptor is used to entangle select visual descriptors with one another. A simplified example of this is if the variance for saturation is high, the quantum factor applied on the value for contrast will increase its value as well. This creates a difference between people who score a 50% on saturation because their answers consistently place them at 50% for saturation, and people who score a 50% on saturation because their scores vary from 0% to 100% and ended up averaging out to 50% for saturation.<br><br>
                        Phew, that was a mouthful! Listen, the cool tech gives us more accurate results, and llet's be honest, we also think it's just really cool.<br>
                        Note: pre-launch orders do not include the quantum layer.<br><br>

                         <br> <br>Sitôt is an R&D studio that creates custom abstract art pieces that accurately captures the look and feel of your personality, visualizing who you are on canvas. The snapshot session questionnaire combines domain knowledge and quantum properties to place you on a spectrum for each of our 40 visual descriptors that a human artist then uses to inform the final design of your personality portrait; from colours, composition, textures, to which painting techniques are best suited to visualize who you are inside.<br>
                         Each personality portrait's design is 100% human-created, and is a result of your answers to the snapshot questionnaire, cross-modal perception theories applied through cutting-edge software, and the irreplaceable eye & craftsmanship of a human artist.
