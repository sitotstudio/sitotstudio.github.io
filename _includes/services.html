Are we able to distill an artist's tastes and abilities to execute into a service... While providing creative fulfillment? By maximizing room for creativity, we want to enable artists to provide their skills while being energized for their own personal projects. </p>

                    <p class="text-muted">Our team of software engineers are first and foremost creatives. We believe that software of scale is overrepresented, and in the same way we have mass-produced tables, we also have hand-carved tables. Software is the same, where it can be crafted in such a way that requires the human touch, and it shows through the tailored and sensitive nature of how we translate human personalities to something visual.</p>
